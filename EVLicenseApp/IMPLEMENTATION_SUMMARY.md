  - ACR1222L, ACR1251U, ACR1252U
  - ACR1255U-J1, ACR1281U-C1, ACR1283L

#### Build Configuration
- Added USB support dependencies
- Maintained compatibility with existing NFC code
- Updated repositories for dependency resolution

### âœ… User Experience Improvements

#### Dashboard Enhancements
- **NFC Status Card**: Shows real-time status of both NFC types
- **Clear Indicators**: "Built-in NFC: Enabled/Disabled/Not Available"
- **External Status**: "External NFC: Connected/Not Connected"

#### Automatic Detection
- **Hot-plug Support**: Detects ACR122U when connected during app runtime
- **Permission Handling**: Automatic USB permission requests
- **Status Updates**: Real-time notifications of connection changes

#### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Clear feedback for connection issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works with available NFC options
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Detailed error information

### âœ… Technical Specifications

#### USB Communication
- **Protocol**: USB HID (Human Interface Device)
- **Commands**: APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit)
- **Endpoints**: Bulk transfer IN/OUT
- **Timeout**: 5-second operation timeout
- **Polling**: 1-second interval for card detection

#### Supported Card Types
- MIFARE Classic (1K, 4K)
- MIFARE Ultralight
- MIFARE DESFire
- NTAG213/215/216
- ISO14443 Type A and B cards

#### Device Support
- **Primary**: ACR122U NFC Reader
- **Compatible**: Other ACS ACR series readers
- **Requirements**: USB OTG support, adequate power supply

## Hardware Requirements

### For ACR122U Support
- Android device with USB OTG capability
- USB OTG cable or adapter
- ACR122U NFC Reader
- Adequate power supply (may need external power)

### Compatibility
- **Minimum SDK**: Android 8.0 (API 26)
