## Description
Develop the screens and logic for adding, editing, deleting, and searching licenses. Ensure data validation and offline support.

## Steps
1. Design forms for adding and editing licenses (fields: holder name, mobile, city, type, number, NFC card, validity).
2. Implement add, edit, and delete functionality using Room (SQLite) for local storage.
3. Implement search by license number or name.
4. Validate all form inputs and highlight errors.
5. Ensure offline support and plan for future sync with backend.
6. Connect CRUD actions to dashboard and NFC features.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can add, edit, delete, and search licenses.
- All data is validated and stored locally.
- UI is user-friendly and error messages are clear.
- CRUD features integrate with dashboard and NFC.

## Notes
- Use ViewModel, LiveData, and Room for best practices.
