## Description
Create the main dashboard screen to display summary statistics and provide quick actions for license management.

## Steps
1. Design the dashboard layout using Material Design 3 guidelines.
2. Add summary statistics (e.g., count by license type, total licenses).
3. Implement quick action buttons (Add License, Write to NFC, Search License).
4. Ensure the dashboard is responsive and accessible on various screen sizes.
5. Connect dashboard actions to their respective screens (placeholders if not yet implemented).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dashboard UI is visually appealing and matches design guidelines.
- Summary statistics and quick actions are present and functional.
- Layout adapts to different device sizes.

## Notes
- Use ViewModel and LiveData for UI state management.
