## Description
Develop the login screen UI and implement authentication logic using email/password. Ensure secure credential storage and session persistence.

## Steps
1. Design the login screen using Material Design components.
2. Implement form validation for email and password fields.
3. Integrate authentication logic (local or via API, as available).
4. Store user credentials securely using EncryptedSharedPreferences or DataStore.
5. Implement session persistence and auto-login if credentials are valid.
6. Add error handling for failed logins and invalid credentials.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Login screen is functional and visually matches design guidelines.
- Authentication works with valid credentials and rejects invalid ones.
- Credentials are stored securely on device.
- Session persists across app restarts.

## Notes
- Use Android Jetpack libraries for best practices.
- Plan for future integration with backend API.
