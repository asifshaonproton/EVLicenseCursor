## Description
Initialize the Android project using Android Studio, set up the base directory structure, and configure version control with Git. This task lays the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Steps
1. Create a new Android project in Android Studio (Kotlin, minimum SDK 26).
2. Set up the package name and project name as "EV License Manager Mobile".
3. Configure the project to use Material Design 3 and Jetpack libraries.
4. Initialize a Git repository in the project root.
5. Add a .gitignore file for Android/Kotlin projects.
6. Make the initial commit with the base project structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Android project is created and builds successfully.
- Git repository is initialized and .gitignore is present.
- Initial commit includes all base files and directories.
- Project is ready for further development.

## Notes
- Use the latest stable versions of Kotlin and Gradle.
- Ensure the project structure is clean and follows Android best practices.
